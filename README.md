## 🎯 Architecture & Design Decisions

### State Management Strategy

**React Query + Context API Hybrid Approach**

We chose a hybrid approach combining React Query for server state and Context API for client state:

- **React Query with Infinite Queries** manages server-side data (todos from API)
  - Automatic caching and background refetching
  - Infinite scrolling with pagination support
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
  - Built-in loading and error states
  - Reduces boilerplate code significantly

- **Context API** manages client-side state (search filters, UI state)
  - Lightweight for simple client state
  - Real-time search functionality
  - No additional dependencies
  - Easy to understand and maintain

### Component Architecture

**Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component has a clear, single purpose:

- `TodoList` - Container, layout logic, and infinite scroll management
- `TodoItem` - Individual todo display and interactions  
- `AddTodo` - Todo creation form logic with optimistic updates
- `SearchFilter` - Real-time search functionality

**Composition over Inheritance**
Components are designed to be composed together, making them reusable and testable.

### Data Flow

```
API (JSONPlaceholder) 
    ↓
TodoService (API abstraction with pagination)
    ↓  
React Query Infinite Queries (Server state + caching)
    ↓
TodoProvider (State distribution + search logic)
    ↓
Components (UI rendering + infinite scroll)
```

### TypeScript Integration

**Strict Type Safety**
- All components are fully typed
- API responses have defined interfaces
- Custom hooks with proper return types
- Utility functions with input/output typing

### Styling Approach

**Tailwind CSS Utility-First**
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Consistent design system
- Easy customization and theming
- Optimized bundle size (only used classes included)

### Performance Optimizations

1. **React Query Infinite Caching** - Intelligent data caching with pagination reduces API calls
2. **useMemo for Filtering** - Prevents unnecessary recalculations during search
3. **Intersection Observer** - Efficient infinite scroll implementation
4. **Component Composition** - Reduces prop drilling
5. **Optimistic Updates** - UI updates immediately, syncs with server later
6. **Lazy Loading** - Load todos on demand as user scrolls

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**
- Loading states with beautiful skeleton UI and Thai language support
- Error boundaries for unexpected failures
- User-friendly error messages in Thai
- Retry functionality where appropriate
- Empty states with helpful guidance

### Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast color scheme
- Focus management
